## Today's Agenda:

- LED Array Selection
- Motor Selection: [Related Blog](https://medium.com/husarion-blog/10-steps-to-choosing-the-right-motors-for-your-robotic-project-bf5c4b997407)
- Micro Controller Selection: [Related Blog](https://community.arm.com/arm-community-blogs/b/embedded-blog/posts/10-steps-to-selecting-a-microcontroller)

## Today's Minutes:

=> Computer sends snapshot of glowing/unglowing LED. This snapshot goes to LED cotrlr. Has grid. For Example: Grid - col 4 row 1 = 1 (glowing) else 0 (off). LED ctrlr: that = 1 else = 0. USB input (c) -> translate -> this/that pin no. is glowing. New snapshot -> update. Speed of snapshots ctrled by PC connected with USB. LED Controllor -> translator to transfer binary info to separate pins.

- C compiler for given architecture.
- Memory needs: not too much (proportional to size of LED matrix).
- Power costs/constraints: to be discussed.
- 2 progs: led ctrler; driver code.
- polygon to voxel translator.
- voxel to snapshots translation (depends on RPM and framerate)

=> Motor: Lower/increase RPM

## Today's Resolutions:

- None as Meet is to be held
